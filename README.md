# PythonCodingChallenges

---
A collection of coding challenges solved using Python 3. 
These challenges are organized by level of difficulty, 
with an emphasis on using Python syntax knowledge to provide concise solutions. 

---

## Challenge Question Sources
The challenge questions come from a variety of sources, such as:
- LeetCode
- Codecademy
- CodeSignal
- And other popular code challenge sources

Note that many challenge questions are often common and can be found in multiple sources, 
thus they are not usually unique to a given platform.

## Approach
The solutions to these challenges contains a mix of generic solutions, and Python specific solutions. 
The Python specific solutions focus on providing a concise solution rather than a verbose, generalized solution. 
This leverages Python language specific knowledge to provide a clear, concise solution to a problem.

Some challenges contain restrictions, such as not using Python built-in string functions, etc. 
For those challenges, we will abide by the rules and avoid using Python language specific solutions which may make the solution much easier. 
The objective in those challenges is often to test general programming and algorithm knowledge, and using Python specific shortcuts would not reinforce the concept.
